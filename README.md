Add-on for Google Sheets to find next empty row

I was tired of endless scrolling of a long sheet to find the last row so I could append cells.  So, I created this add-on to find the next empty row (looking at the first 999 columns).

It's very simple.  Total time from first reading how to create an add-on to project completion was about 2 hours while doing laundry.
